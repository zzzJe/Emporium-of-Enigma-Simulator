## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- tkinter

- seaborn
- numpy

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/SgtSlayer3/Emporium-of-Enigma-Simulator.git
$ cd Emporium-of-Enigma-Simulator
$ python3 -m venv venv (optional)
$ source venv/bin/activate (optional)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

```sh
$ python main.py
```

## Features
- Main menu allowing the selection of either Rewards from Keys or Keys Needed for pearls
- Keys Needed for pearls
   - Simulates how many Keys are needed to reach a pear goal selected by the users.
   - Results in a Histogram displaying the output across simulations.
- Rewards from Keys
   - Simulates the amount of pearls you will receive from an amount of keys imputed by the user.
   - Results in a Histogram displaying the output across simulations.

## Future updates
- Calculate all rewards from keys.
- Allow the user to togle packs to get an amount of keys instead of just typing in an integer.
